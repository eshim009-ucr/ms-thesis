I am grateful to my advisor Philip Brisk, without whose guidance, feedback,
support, and advocacy I would not have be here.

I am grateful to Prithviraj Yuvaraj, whose support on the navigating Vitis HLS
and the OCT testbed have been invaluable to my engineering efforts.

I am grateful to my friends in Kansas for telling me about Zotero to keep track
of all my references.
