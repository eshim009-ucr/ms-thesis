Both FPGAs and RDMA have seen increasing adoption in datacenters as a means of overcoming the bottlenecks of parallelism needed in modern applications. We propose a novel database architecture built around a distributed FPGA system with RDMA as its interconnect in order to implement high-performance, in-memory key-value store.
