The database was implemented on a cluster of 8 nodes that share a single network switch as shown in figure \ref{oct-arch}. Each node has a Xilinx Alveo U280 PCIe card, containing a XCU280 FPGA and $\SI{8}{\giga\byte}$ of high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Each node is connected to the switch with a $\SI{100}{\giga\bit}$ NIC.
