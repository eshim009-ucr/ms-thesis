\sect{Conclusions}

The FPGA tree engine offers a modest increase in throughput at higher entry
counts, though there remains room for further improvement. The limitations on
HBM size can be circumvented by distributing the system across a cluster using
RDMA as \citeauthor{base} do with their CPU B-Link tree. The same strategy can
also be used to circumvent routing issues, as can the creation of a custom
internal memory pipeline.

As shown in \autoref{fig:floorplan} and \autoref{table:resource-usage}, the
majority of the FPGA fabric remains available for utilization by additional
instances of the kernel for greater parallelism.
