I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my advisor Philip Brisk,
without whose guidance, feedback, support, and advocacy I would not be here. Not
all of the challenges I faced have been expected, but he has supported me
through all of them.

Additionally, I would like to express my gratitude to Prithviraj Yuvaraj, whose
support navigating Vitis HLS software toolchain and the OCT testbed have been
invaluable to my efforts in implementing the system designed here.

Finally, I am grateful to my friends in Kansas for telling me about Zotero,
which has been immensely useful in keeping track of all my references.
