\sect{Experiment}

FPGA data was collected on a system with a Xilinx Alveo U280 PCIe card,
containing a XCU280 FPGA and $\SI{8}{\giga\byte}$ of on-chip high-bandwidth
memory (HBM) \autocite{u280}. The CPU baseline was collected on a system with an
Intel Core i9-9900 CPU and $\SI{32}{\giga\byte}$ of installed RAM running Ubuntu
20.04 LTS.
