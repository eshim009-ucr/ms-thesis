\subsect{Setup}

FPGA data was collected on a system with a Xilinx Alveo U280 PCIe card,
which contains an XCU280 FPGA with $\SI{8}{\giga\byte}$ of on-chip HBM as well
as $\SI{32}{\giga\byte}$ DDR4 memory on two RDIMMs operating at
$\SI{2400}{\mega{T}\per\second}$ \autocite{u280}. The CPU baseline was collected
on a system with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and $\SI{96}{\giga\byte}$ of DDR5
memory on four UDIMMs operating at $\SI{3600}{\mega{T}\per\second}$. The system
is running AlmaLinux 9.6 (binary compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and
kernel version 5.14.0.

Unless stated otherwise, a branching factor of $m=8$ will be used in all
experiments.
