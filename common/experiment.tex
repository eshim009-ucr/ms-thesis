\sect{Experiment}

FPGA data was collected on a system with a Xilinx Alveo U280 PCIe card,
containing a XCU280 FPGA, $\SI{8}{\giga\byte}$ of on-chip HBM, and
$\SI{32}{\giga\byte}$ DDR4 memory on two RDIMMs operating at
$\SI{2400}{\mega{T}\per\second}$ \autocite{u280}. The CPU baseline was collected
on a system with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and $\SI{96}{\giga\byte}$ of DDR5 on 4
UDIMMs operating at $\SI{3600}{\mega{T}\per\second}$ memory running AlmaLinux
9.6.

Unless stated otherwise, a branching factor of $m=8$ will be used in all
experiments.
