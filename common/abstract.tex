Both FPGAs and RDMA have seen increasing adoption in datacenters as a means of achieving the parallelism and responsiveness needed in modern applications. However, attempts to combine the two are still CPU-centric. We propose a novel database architecture built around a distributed FPGA cluster with RDMA as its interconnect in order to implement high-performance, in-memory key-value store based on the B-Link tree.
