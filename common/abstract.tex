FPGAs have seen increasing adoption in datacenters as a means of achieving the
parallelism and responsiveness needed in modern applications. However, most use
cases remain CPU-centric, often citing the difficulty of implementation for
complex database structures \autocite{honeycomb} in hardware description
languages (HDLs). Advances in high-level synthesis (HLS) frameworks allow for
existing software solutions to be converted for deployment on FPGAs. We propose
a novel database architecture which uses an HLS design running on an FPGA
running as the sole processing element for in-memory key-value store based on
\citeauthor{base}'s implementation \autocite{base} of \citeauthor{b-link}'s
B-Link tree \autocite{b-link}.
