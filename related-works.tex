\subsection{In Software}

\citeauthor{dlsm} propose using Log-Structured Merge Trees as a higher-performance alternative to B-trees. However, their system architecture assumes a heterogeneous cluster with some nodes dedicated to memory and other dedicated to processing \cite{dlsm}.


\subsection{Hardware Acceleration}

Utilizing more of the U280's memory hierarchy that could be leveraged for some of these caching effects. In addition to the $\SI{8}{\giga\byte}$ of HBM used in this experiment, it has $\SI{32}{\giga\byte}$ of slower, off-chip DDR and $\SI{41}{\kilo\byte}$ of faster, on-chip block RAM (BRAM) and UltraRAM (URAM).
