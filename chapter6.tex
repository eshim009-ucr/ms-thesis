\section{Further Research}

The U280 card contains an entire memory heirarchy that could be leveraged for improved performance using caching. In addition to the $\SI{8}{\giga\byte}$ of HBM used in this experiment, it has $\SI{32}{\giga\byte}$ of slower, off-chip DDR and $\SI{41}{\kilo\byte}$ of faster, on-chip block RAM (BRAM) and UltraRAM.
